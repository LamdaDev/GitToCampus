## GitToCampus

_Find your building fast. Never miss a class._

**GitToCampus** is a mobile campus navigation companion built for Concordia University students, staff, and visitors. It makes it effortless to find your way around **SGW and Loyola** from locating buildings and rooms to getting step-by-step directions between classes.

With an interactive campus map and smart routing, GitToCampus helps you:
- Explore campus buildings with clear, campus-specific highlights (so you don’t confuse them with surrounding city blocks)
- Get **outdoor directions** between buildings with multiple travel modes
- Navigate to your **next class automatically** by connecting to your schedule (e.g., calendar or course data)
- Use **indoor directions** to find classrooms and key points of interest (washrooms, stairs, elevators, water fountains), including accessibility-friendly routes

Designed with usability and accessibility in mind, GitToCampus is built to reduce “first-week lost” moments and help users move confidently across campus.
